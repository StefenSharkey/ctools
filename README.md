# ctools
A collection of libraries, data structures, and more that I have created to make coding in C less painful.

# Data structures
There are many data structure implementations in this repository, and they take two main forms:
- Macro-based
- Function-based

The distinction lies in how the operations are invoked. Macro-based data structures revolve around using
macros as the operations themselves, while function-based implementations use macros to generate functions
that are used as the operations.

Both of these strategies solve the problem of type-safety, but whether or not one is better than the other
is dependant on the programmer.
